# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

With the rising number of fraud cases, every Credit Card Companyâ€™s major focus is to provide its customers with a delightful experience while ensuring that security is not compromised.

Through this project, we detect fraudulent transactions, wherein once a cardmember swipes their card for payment, the transaction is classified as fraudulent or authentic based on a set of predefined rules. If fraud is detected, then the transaction must be declined. If a transaction is incorrectly classified as fraudulent,the company will incur huge losses & will also provoke negative consumer sentiment. So it is extremely vital to classify a transaction correctly.

We also update the customer info on the platform from where the customer support team can retrieve relevant information in real-time to resolve customer complaints and queries.
